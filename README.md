# Django + Tailwind CSS + React

Django + Tailwind CSS + React = ðŸ§¡

## Introduction

This project combines Django (a high-level Python web framework) with Tailwind CSS (a utility-first CSS framework) and React (a JavaScript library for building user interfaces) to create a modern web application.

## Features

- **Django**: Backend framework that handles server-side logic and database interactions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React**: Frontend library for building dynamic user interfaces.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thenameisajay/dj-tailwind-react.git
    cd dj-tailwind-react
    ```

2. **Set up the backend**:
    - Create a virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv env
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
    - Install the required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Apply the migrations:
        ```bash
        python manage.py migrate
        ```
    - Start the Django development server:
        ```bash
        python manage.py runserver
        ```

3. **Set up the frontend**:
    - Navigate to the frontend directory:
        ```bash
        cd frontend
        ```
    - Install the required npm packages:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - Start the React development server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```

## Usage

Once the servers are running, you can access the application at `http://localhost:8000` for the Django backend and `http://localhost:3000` for the React frontend.
